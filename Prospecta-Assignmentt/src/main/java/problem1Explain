 Question: what are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API to ensure that it is secure and reliable?

Ans: 1. I will use the Spring Security for Security purpose to know the customer is valid or not
		
	 2 I will handle all the exceptions to know the error where i am getting.
	 
	 3. I will use the validation to know if the input is valid or not.
